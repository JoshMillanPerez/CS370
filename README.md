Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
On this project we used deep Q-lerning to guide a tresure hunter though a maze to reach the tresure. We were given the skeleton code and basic inputs asa well as all the prerequisite material to run the code. We had to implement deep q-learning strategies in order to ge tthe treasure hunter to reach the trreasure by trail and error.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
Thorughtout this course we learned on incorporating deep Q-learning skills in order to get a computer to leanr to do things after trial and error. This is big becuase recently there has been big advancements in AI and computer learning.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scienetinst find ways to create systems to better help our daily lives. Whether that be analizing a situation, or having a computer create cenarios to help us achieve our goals.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
In order to aproach problem as a computer scientist you need to analyze the goal or issuenat hand. Then you need to see all the variables and account for them. Then you start your project after figuring out all the important atributes.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethical responsibiilites are the same from any other field in my opinion. Is this going to help or affect people. Am I crossing the bounderies with peoples privacy or could my code be used in a way that can. It all falls behind gthe intentions that you have with your code.
